# GROUP DISCUSSIONS

### Why are we interested in advertisements? 
If you're not using an adblocker those online advertisements can be quite irritating. Also they are a bit terryfing as it's so obvious that a lot of information about yourself is used in order to create thos ads. 
It's such a common and for us already normal thing to look at advertisements whether it's offline or online. So we're completely used to it and aware of them but at the same time don't look at them critical enough maybe. 


## Unusefulness of them - using them in an artistic way
for example seeing a webpage as a grid - all fields that would be filled with ads can be filled with  primary colours - creating online mondriaan pictures

## Questions and thoughts

- Sometimes it's not clear where ads are coming from. Would it be possible to trace them back? Is it always logical or do we also get random ads?
- How much time do we spend on ads on average? 
- For how long are they visible on our screen? Do we click on them? Do we look at them? 
- Do we consciously make use of them? (in the sense of buying the products) 
- What kind of information is lying behind those ads, especially from automatically generated ads? 
- Are they comprehensible? 
- In how far are they entering our privacy?
- How much space are online advertisements occupying? 
- How high is the percentage of ads from the whole site or screen size?


Is it possible to scrape every single advertisement that is blocked by a ad blocker? How much would that be per hour/day/week  or during a specific self chosen period of time?

How much data (wifi or mobile) is used for loading the advertisements? This is in particular intereseting for mobile devices because there the costs for internet are calculated through downloaded mb and are higher than wifi or broadband internet costs. 
Interactive ads need more data. Simple one-picture ads of course need less. 

Lies the ad blocker on top of the ads? Does it actually need some extra data to block it? (We found out that an ad blocker is blocking the ad server so the answer is - no, the ads aren't even loading)


Creating a plug-in for internet browsers
x it should be simple to understand and to use
x information visualized through a graph

What kind of information do we want to scrape exactly?
x loading times for a whole page (not only ad)
x what % of the whole loading time of the page was for ads?
x for the day, how much of your time have ads taken up?
x exact data: mb's, per day, month, since you downloaded the plug-in, chose yourself a specific period
