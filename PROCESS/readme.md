GROUP DISCUSSIONS

Why are we interested in advertisements? 
If you're not using an adblocker those online advertisements can be quite irritating. Also they are a bit terryfing as it's so obvious that a lot of information about yourself is used in order to create thos ads. 
It's such a common and for us already normal thing to look at advertisements whether it's offline or online. So we're completely used to it and aware of them but at the same time don't look at them critical enough maybe. 


Unusefulness of them - using them in an artistic way
for example seeing a webpage as a grid - all fields that would be filled with ads can be filled with  primary colours - creating online mondriaan pictures

Sometimes it's not clear where ads are coming from. Would it be possible to trace them back? Is it always logical or do we also get random ads?

How much time do we spend on ads on average? For how long are they visible on our screen? Do we click on them? Do we look at them? 
Do we consciously make use of them? (in the sense of buying the products) 

What kind of information is lying behind those ads, especially from automatically generated ads? Are they comprehensible? 
In how far are they entering our privacy?
