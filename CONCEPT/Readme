ideas, thoughts and concept description for online advertisement data-scraping project

It's striking that some ads are more data-heavy than others when it comes to data usage for loading.
We're interested in how much of the data in our daily online lives is used for loading and screening ads and is therefore unwanted. 
Usefulness: In terms of using cellular data, as well as, loading webpages quickly using Wi-Fi, how much internet data is used to load ads?  
We want to then compare interactive ads that give you the possibility to play games, watch videos or listen to sounds to simple one-picture ads.
