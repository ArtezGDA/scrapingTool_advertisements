# AD MINER

## **CHROME PLUGIN TO MINING AD DATA**

### Concept & Idea

If you're not using an adblocker those online advertisements can be quite irritating. Besides that they arenâ€™t only occupying space on your screen but also take time and even more important data to (down)load. 
It's striking that some ads are more data-heavy than others when it comes to data usage for loading.
We're interested in how much of the data in our daily online lives is used for loading and screening ads and is therefore unwanted. 
Usefulness: In terms of using cellular data, as well as, loading webpages quickly using Wi-Fi, how much internet data is used to load ads?  
We want to then compare interactive ads that give you the possibility to play games, watch videos or listen to sounds to simple one-picture ads. 

###### We developed this prototype for a browser plug-in which is
* simple to understand and to use and
* visualises information through a graph



### What can it scrape?
- the exact loading times for a whole page for one internet session
- the percentage of the loading time (mentioned above) that was needed for ads 
- the amount of time it took to load ads for a whole day 
- exact and customized data: mb/s: per day, month, since you downloaded the plug-in, you can chose what you want to scrape 


## What does this Github page contain?
- Folder Demo-Prototype: The actual and final prototype
- Folder Proces: Contains information of the group discussions, ideas, questions and thoughts
