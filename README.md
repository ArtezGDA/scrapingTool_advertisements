# AD MINER

CHROME PLUGIN TO MINING AD DATA

### CONCEPT

If you're not using an adblocker those online advertisements can be quite irritating. Besides that they arenâ€™t only occupying space on your screen but also take time and even more important data to (down)load. 

###### We developed this prototype for a browser plug-in which is
* simple to understand and to use and
* visualises information through a graph



### What can it scrape?
- the exact loading times for a whole page for one internet session
- the percentage of the loading time (mentioned above) that was needed for ads 
- the amount of time it took to load ads for a whole day 
- exact and customized data: mb/s: per day, month, since you downloaded the plug-in, you can chose what you want to scrape
